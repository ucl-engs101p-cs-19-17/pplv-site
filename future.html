          <h1>Future of the research</h1>
          <p>
            The research group works hard on automatic verification can be seen as part of a larger trend in applied logic, where mathematical logic is moving from being a conceptual mathematical tool to a collection of techniques which can be used by practising engineers and scientists in solving the concrete problems that they face. They also will do projects on logic tools, systems, logic frameworks and language logic(syntax) with semantic truth.

            A recently announced research project within the department is EPS interface reasoning for interactive systems. Logic is used as a modelling technology for analysing and reasoning with programs at all scales/ levels of abstraction. Project has received a £7,000,000 over 6 years.
