          <h2>Current direction of research</h2>

          <h3>Aim</h3>
          <p>
            The goal of the group's research is to produce mathematically rigorous concepts and techniques that aid in the construction and analysis of computer and information systems, and to make fundamental contributions to the underlying logic, mathematics, and computer science that supports our work.
          </p>

          <h3>Impact on the world</h3>
          <p>
            It has great impact on both computational area and mathematical area, from code structure, to reasoning the programming and correctness of programming.
          </p>
          <p>
            The theory is also used by real world application e.g. They developed a new kind of logic application for programming correctness called Bunched, which is a analysis tool used widely by big companies.
          </p>
          <p>
            The research done so far are also used to reduce bugs in programming, demonstrate language logic and semantic truth.
          </p>

          <h3>How are the findings used/who has used it?</h3>
          <p>
            Some software companies in big names, e.g Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft use the research for programming correctness, security, logic learning and so on. Also the mathematical area is a significant part of PPLV, plenty of researches contribute on it, and most researchers in PPLV are mathematician.

          <h3>A real world application</h3>

          <p>
            Applications in programming correctness lead to the creation of verifications tools. These are currently being used by Facebook under the program name “Infer” (program analysis tool). It is mainly used within mobile updates to ensure correctness due to the general public often being more reluctant to update mobile software, and it being harder to push updates.

            Applying logical ideas to reasoning the correctness of programmes. Correctness: described using logical language (prior, during and after).

          <h2>Future of the research</h2>
          <p>
            The research group works hard on automatic verification, which can be seen as part of a larger trend in applied logic, where mathematical logic is moving from being a conceptual mathematical tool to a collection of techniques which can be used by practising engineers and scientists in solving the concrete problems that they face. They also will do projects on logic tools, systems, logic frameworks and language logic(syntax) with semantic truth.

          <p>
            A recently announced research project within the department is EPS interface reasoning for interactive systems. Logic is used as a modelling technology for analysing and reasoning with programs at all scales and levels of abstraction. The project has received a £7,000,000 over 6 years.
