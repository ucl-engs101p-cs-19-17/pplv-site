          <h2>What is the research?</h2>
          <p>
            The research covers areas of logic, semantics, language design, program analysis, program and systems verification, systems modelling, compilation, and theorem proving which are applied in both practice and theory.
          </p>
          <p>
            The group aims to not only aid in the building and analysis of systems, but to also help develop the fundamental and underlying ideas within logic, mathematics and computer science that currently aid their work. As a means of doing this they produce “mathematically rigorous concepts”. Moreover, they also strongly wish to build upon their research through application of logic further afield in areas such as artificial intelligence, security, biology, and economics.

          <h2>What would the world be like without the existence of this research?</h2>
          <p>Quite simply: the collapse of society.</p>
          <p>
            Programs in general would be clumsy, and it’d be much more difficult to use programming languages. There would be many more faults and bugs in programs, causing them to break often.
          </p>
          <p>
            This would, in turn, have a huge impact on society as we are dependent upon complex, highly distributed computer systems. As a result, if these were to fail, utilities and systems part of everyday life would fail. Things would go wrong more often, leading to chaos in the world.
