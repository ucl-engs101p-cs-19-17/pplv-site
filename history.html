          <h2>Logic:</h2>
          <p>
            Logic was first introduced in ancient Egypt and Babylon, but the one we are using now was developed in ancient Greece by great philosophers and mathematicians like Aristotle, who has established the basic principle of formal logic and Syllogism (deduction of logic), these core concepts have become the cornerstone of logic nowadays. As time goes on, logic is used broadly in modern scientific areas, especially mathematics and computer science. This is the time when George Boole formalised symbolic logic and defined what is now called Boolean algebra in his first book The Mathematical Analysis of Logic (1847), those ideas were then widely used in computation and programming in the 20th century.

            In aspect of logic programming, representing and executing computer programs using logic is a feature of the lambda calculus (λ-calculus), which is a formal system in mathematical logic, expressing function abstraction and application in computation, was first introduced by Alonzo Church in the 1930s. Yet, the formal ‘birth’ of logic programming happened in the 1970s, when computer scientists developed early automated theorem proving and artificial intelligence. They have managed to fuse the two strikingly different concepts of program and logic together. Subsequently, logic programming has grown rapidly. In particular, programming language based on the first-order predicate logic is well known by its rich ability of expression, non-determinacy and its application of logical reasoning onto calculations. The technique is then widely applied to theorem proves, program verification and modular programming.

          <h2>Verification:</h2>
          <p>
            This fundamental piece of modern programming began in the 1950s, when great mathematicians like Turing and Von Neuman were hand-proving for program correctness. About a decade later, in the late 1960s, Robert Floyd and Tony Hoare introduced assertional reasoning on flowcharts for proving partial and total correctness and axiomatic semantics for programming constructs, which are commonly known as the Floyd-Hoare Logic.

          <p>
            Since then, the industry started to grow. In the next 30 years, enormous number of capable scientists came up with brilliant ideas and theories like predicate transformer semantics and abstract interpretation. Many of them have researched in fields like Model checking, hardware verification, some have even developed the typed languages (i.e. Z specification language, typed assembly language), which are languages that give rules to variable. A variable cannot start off life without knowing the range of values it can hold, and once it is declared, the data type of the variable cannot change. Simultaneously, the technology was applied to large-scale program analysis, it was used in world-widely in every industry, developing kernel for computers or even building system for aircrafts, benefiting the society in a safer and more reliable way.
