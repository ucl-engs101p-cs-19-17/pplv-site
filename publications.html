          <h3>Galmiche, D., Kimmel, P., & Pym, D. (2017). A substructural epistemic resource logic.</h3>
          <p>
            We present a substructural epistemic logic, based on Boolean BI, in which the epistemic modalities are parametrized on agents’ local resources. The new modalities can be seen as generalizations of the usual epistemic modalities. The logic combines Boolean Bl’s resource semantics with epistemic agency. We give a labelled tableaux calculus and establish soundness and completeness with respect to the resource semantics. We illustrate the use of the logic by discussing an example of side-channels in access control using resource tokens.

          <h3>Docherty, S., & Pym, D. (2016). Intuitionistic layered graph logic.</h3>
          <p>
            Models of complex systems are widely used in the physical and social sciences, and the concept of layering, typically building upon graph-theoretic structure, is a common feature. We describe an intuitionistic substructural logic that gives an account of layering. As in bunched systems, the logic includes the usual intuitionistic connectives, together with a non-commutative, non-associative conjunction (used to capture layering) and its associated implications. We give soundness and completeness theorems for labelled tableaux and Hilbert-type systems with respect to a Kripke semantics on graphs. To demonstrate the utility of the logic, we show how to represent a range of systems and security examples, illuminating the relationship between services/policies and the infrastructures/architectures to which they are applied.

          <h3>Caulfield, T., Ioannidis, C., & Pym, D. (2016). On the adoption of privacy-enhancing technologies.</h3>
          <p>
            We propose a model, based on the work of Brock and Durlauf, which looks at how agents make choices between competing technologies, as a framework for exploring aspects of the economics of the adoption of privacy-enhancing technologies. In order to formulate a model of decision-making among choices of technologies by these agents, we consider the following: context, the setting in which and the purpose for which a given technology is used; requirement, the level of privacy that the technology must provide for an agent to be willing to use the technology in a given context; belief, an agent’s perception of the level of privacy provided by a given technology in a given context; and the relative value of privacy, how much an agent cares about privacy in this context and how willing an agent is to trade off privacy for other attributes. We introduce these concepts into the model, admitting heterogeneity among agents in order to capture variations in requirement, belief, and relative value in the population. We illustrate the model with two examples: the possible effects on the adoption of iOS devices being caused by the recent Apple–FBI case; and the recent revelations about the non-deletion of images on the adoption of Snapchat.

          <h3>Brotherston, J. (2010). A Unified Display Proof Theory for Bunched Logic.</h3>
          <p>
            We formulate a unified display calculus proof theory for the four principal varieties of bunched logic by combining display calculi for their component logics. Our calculi satisfy cut-elimination, and are sound and complete with respect to their standard presentations. We show that the standard sequent calculus for BI can be seen as a reformulation of its display calculus, and argue that analogous sequent calculi for the other varieties of bunched logic seem very unlikely to exist.

          <h3>Rowe, R. N. S., & Brotherston, J. (2017). Automatic cyclic termination proofs for recursive procedures in separation logic.</h3>
          <p>
            We describe a formal verification framework and tool implementation, based upon cyclic proofs, for certifying the safe termination of imperative pointer programs with recursive procedures. Our assertions are symbolic heaps in separation logic with user defined inductive predicates; we employ explicit approximations of these predicates as our termination measures. This enables us to extend cyclic proof to programs with procedures by relating these measures across the preand postconditions of procedure calls. We provide an implementation of our formal proof system in the CYCLIST theorem proving framework, and evaluate its performance on a range of examples drawn from the literature on program termination. Our implementation extends the current state-of-the-art in cyclic proof-based program verification, enabling automatic termination proofs of a larger set of programs than previously possible.

          <h3>Pym, D., & Tofts, C. (2006). A calculus and logic of resources and processes.</h3>
          <p>
            Recent advances in logics for reasoning about resources provide a new approach to compositional reasoning in interacting systems. We present a calculus of resources and processes, based on a development of Milner's synchronous calculus of communication systems, SCCS, that uses an explicit model of resource. Our calculus models the co-evolution of resources and processes with synchronization constrained by the availability of resources. We provide a logical characterization, analogous to Hennessy-Milner logic's characterization of bisimulation in CCS, of bisimulation between resource processes which is compositional in the concurrent and local structure of systems. © British Computer Society 2006.

          <h3>Caulfield, T., & Pym, D. (n.d.). Improving Security Policy Decisions with Models.</h3>
          <p>
            Security managers face the challenge of designing security policies that deliver the objectives required by their organizations. We explain how a rigorous methodology, grounded in mathematical systems modelling and the economics of decision-making, can be used to explore the operational consequences of their design choices and help security managers to make better decisions. The methodology is based on constructing executable system models that illustrate the effects of different policy choices. Models are designed to be composed, allowing complex systems to be expressed as combinations of smaller, complete models. They capture the logical and physical structure of systems, the choices and behavior of agents within the system, and the security managers' preferences about outcomes. Models are parameterized from observations of the real world and the effectiveness of different security policies is explored through simulation. Utility theory is used to describe the extent to which security managers' policies deliver their security objectives.

          <h3>Pym, D., Collinson, M., & McDonald, K. (2015). Layered Graph Logic as an Assertion Language for Access Control Policy Models.</h3>
          <p>
            We describe a uniform logical framework, based on a bunched logic that combines classical additives and very weak multiplicatives, for reasoning compositionally about access control policy models. We show how our approach takes account of the underlying system architecture, and so provides a way to identify and reason about how vulnerabilities may arise (and be removed) as a result of the architecture of the system. We consider, using frame rules, how local properties of access control policies are maintained as the system architecture evolves.
